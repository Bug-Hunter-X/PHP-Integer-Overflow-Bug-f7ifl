The most robust solution involves using the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) library, which allows for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. This eliminates the risk of integer overflow. 

```php
<?php
// Use the GMP library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic
$largeNumber = gmp_init(9223372036854775807);
$largeNumber = gmp_add($largeNumber, 1);
echo gmp_strval($largeNumber); // Correctly outputs the incremented value
?>
```

**To use the GMP library:**

1. Make sure it's installed on your system.  It's often included by default in most Linux distributions, but you might need to install it on other systems (e.g., using `brew install gmp` on macOS).
2. Ensure the GMP extension is enabled in your PHP configuration (php.ini).  This is usually enabled by default but you might need to uncomment the appropriate line if it is not.
