This code suffers from a potential issue related to how PHP handles integer overflow.  If the value of `$largeNumber` exceeds the maximum value representable by PHP's integer type (which is platform-dependent, typically a 64-bit signed integer), an unexpected integer overflow will occur.  Instead of properly handling the potential overflow, it can lead to unexpected results, such as negative numbers or incorrect calculations.

```php
<?php
$largeNumber = 9223372036854775807; // Maximum 64-bit signed integer
$largeNumber++; // Incrementing it causes overflow
echo $largeNumber; // Outputs a large negative number due to overflow
?>
```
